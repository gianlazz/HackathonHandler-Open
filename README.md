# HackathonHandler-Open
open sourced version of the repo

Removed the following classes for privacy reasons before opensourcing this:

HackathonManager.DIContext/Context.cs

HackathonManager.SrndResourcesManager/SrndMentorCsvDownloader.cs

HackathonManager.DIContext/Credentials.cs


This open sourced repo is thus in a nonbuilding state as a result and is more for reference. 
The actual HackathonHandler.com repo will continue to be closed source for now.
